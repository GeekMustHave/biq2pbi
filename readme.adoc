Research notes on converting or migrating BI-Qurty models into Microsoft Power-BI models.

== Introduction

BI-Query aka GQL has been around for 25+ years.  It is still one of the best `Query` tools for SQL detail queries.

Power-BI from Microsoft is a Business Intelligence tool that could benefit from the work done to create the BI-Query Models.

This effort is to see if it is possible to take exported BI-Query models and use them to help define Power-BI models with the identical attributes.


== BI-Query model

The BI-Query model is a binary object and is difficult to read.

Bi-Query does have the method to export the model to a text file which if formatted correctly could be used for the migration.

An example of the exported BI-Query model can be found at this link:./documents/MegaModel.txt[ link,window='_blank']

=== Hierarchy

There is a hierarchy of sections for a BIQ model.

* Heading
* Statistics
* Connections
* Permissions
* Preferences 
* Metadata Help
* Path variables
* Prompts
* Variables
* Design Windows
* `window name`
** Relationships - followed by `Join Condition`
** Tables - followed by `Database Table Name`


== BI-Query Points

There are a number of text-based points that help to define where metadata about the <<BIQ>> model that are helpful to <<PBI>>.

One issue is that the model has (TAB) characters and not spaces.

.Points Reference

|===
| Point Name | Point Description | Point Text | Start Pos | Length 
| srelation | Start of relationships | {tab}Relationships | 3 | 13
| poop | Start pooping | poop | 1 | 4
|===

== Application Prep

The BIQ2PBI utility will be written in Node as a CLI application.

Initially it will read in a designated file with a `*.txt` extension.

=== Node Libraries

==== User Interface

I have been very happy when developing CLI NODE app's in using the following libraries

* Chalk - Terminal string styling done right
* clear - Clear the terminal screen if possible
* figlet - Creates ASCII Art from text. A full implementation of the FIGfont spec.
* inquirer - A collection of common interactive command line user interfaces.

These will all be installed with NPM and the `--save` option to put dependicies in the package.json file.

 npm install --save chalk clear figlet inquirer


==== Reading files

In past experiments I have read files into a sting in the app and read through the string.
The OUT files here can be quite large as the number of request and test set expands.

The alternative is a module `line-reader`, Asynchronous, buffered, line-by-line file/stream reader with support for user-defined line separators.

  npm install --save line-reader

The `eachLine` function reads each line of the given file. Upon each new line, the given callback function is called with two parameters: 
the line read and a boolean value specifying whether the line read was the last line of the file. 
If the callback returns false, reading will stop and the file will be closed.
