== Introduction

BI-Query aka GQL has been around for 25+ years.  It is still one of the best `Query` tools for SQL detail queries.

Power-BI from Microsoft is a Business Intelligence tool that could benefit from the work done to create the BI-Query Models.

This effort is to see if it is possible to take exported BI-Query models and use them to help define Power-BI models with the identical attributes.


== BI-Query model

The BI-Query model is a binary object and is difficult to read.

Bi-Query does have the method to export the model to a text file which if formatted correctly could be used for the migration.

An example of the exported BI-Query model can be found at this link:./documents/BIQ-Model.txt[ link,window='_blank']
